* More accurate time accounting. It's better to remember the absolute time
  when to show a frame, and then compare current time with it, than to
  count time differences manually.

* Change frame instantly when the trackbar is moved

* Let the trackbar show time mm:ss instead of frame number or at least two
  these values

* Develop automatic tests

* Add method for writing asf-files

* Convert avi or any video-files to asf text file (use ffmpeg)

* Add gzip compression mode

* Build a reusable codec (for instance a gstreamer plugin) based on the same
  code to watch ASF in the system player.

* Put License notice to the file header

* Fix bug with closing window

* Add modifiedcontrol panel. Add "<" button
